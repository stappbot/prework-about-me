      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm in school for coding, but have had a few careers.
        <br/>
        Currently, I'm a massage therapist, but I have also worked 
        <br/>
        in animal shelters and as a dog groomer. Fun stuff.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born and raised in good ole Sacramento.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Plants, quilts, drawing, reading, and making things.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would love to be a coder.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>After about 16 years away, I'm back in Sac.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Coding seems like it would offer financial security and 
        <br/>
        the potential of remote work so I can travel more.
        <br/>
        Also, coding seems like a big puzzle and I like puzzles.
