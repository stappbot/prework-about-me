      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm an artist and have had many careers including animal shelter work, dog groomer, and (currently) massage therapist.</p>
      <h1>I'm originally from Sacramento</h1>
      <p>It took me about 16 years away to realize I wanted to come back, including 4 years away at college and 11 years in Chicago.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Quilting, making everything I can instead of buying things, and plants are my hobbies.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would love to be a coder and still do massage therapy, as well.</p>
      <h1>I live in...</h1>
      <p>Good ole Sacramento.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'd love to be able to work remotely and be able to travel the world with my husband... or at least travel more often.</p>
